			Realview PB-A8 Guest

This guest has Cortex-A8 (Single Core ARMv7a) CPU and various peripherals
expected on a Realview Platform Base Board.

We also have memory mapped VirtIO devices located at unused IO regions 
of the guest for providing VirtIO based paravirtualization.

There are many reserved IO regions as per Realview PB-A8 User Guide. From 
these reserved IO regions, we will use the following IO regions for VirtIO:
0x20000000â€“0x3FFFFFFF (512M) (Reserved)

The VirtIO devices also require a IRQ line per device for functioning. The

GIC: 34-35
GIC: 41
