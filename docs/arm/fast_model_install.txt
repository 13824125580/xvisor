		ARM Fast Models Evaluation Installation Guidelines

This readme explains how to install & setup evaluation version of the latest
ARM fast models.

The ARM Fast Models enable developers to generate Programmer's View virtual 
platforms, which are functionally accurate, fast, and scalable. These virtual
platforms enable the parallel development of software and hardware, and are 
fast enough to be used to test applications at close to real-time speeds. 

Please follow the steps below to install & setup ARM fast models on your 
Linux system:

  [1. Register with ARM Ltd. on www.arm.com if not already registered]

  [2. Login on www.arm.com]

  [3. Goto SUPPORT > Resources > Evaluation Products > Fast Models]

  [4. Get your evaluation license.dat and fast model .tgz]

  [5. Unpack fast model .tgz to <your_unpacked_fastmodel_tgz> directory]

  [6. Run <your_unpacked_fastmodel_tgz>/setup.bin and install all packages to <your_fastmodel_dir>]

  [7. Ensure execute permission for fast model environment setup script]
  # chmod +x <your_fastmodel_dir>/FastModelsTools_xxx/source_all.sh

  [8. Setup environment variable for fast model tools from your init scripts (e.g. ~/.bashrc)]
  # export ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE=<path_to_your_license_dat>/license.dat
  # export PATH=<your_fastmodel_dir>/FastModelsTools_xxx/bin:$PATH
  # source <your_fastmodel_dir>/FastModelsTools_xxx/source_all.sh

  [9. Ensure commands mentioned in previous step are executed before proceeding]

  [10. Start system canvas tool to build required emulation model (lets assume Cortex-A15x1)]
  # sgcanvas

  [11. OPEN <your_fastmodel_dir>/FastModelsPortfolio_xxxx/examples/RTSM_VE/Build_Cortex-A15x1/RTSM_VE_Cortex-A15x1.sgproj]

  [12. SELECT Integrated Simulator & Cadilibrary from PROJECT -> PROJECT SETTINGS -> PARAMETER CATEGORY -> TARGETS]

  [13. COMPILE (this will start system canvas build process)]
  (The output emulation model will be shared library named cadi_system_Linux-Debug-GCC-3.4.so located in 
   <your_fastmodel_dir>/FastModelsPortfolio_xxxx/examples/RTSM_VE/Build_Cortex-A15x1/Linux-Debug-GCC-3.4)

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
  (Note: to build a different emulation model redo steps 10 to 13 and 
   select appropriate .sgproj file in step 11)
  (Note: the above steps may slightly differ for older versions of
   ARM fast models)
